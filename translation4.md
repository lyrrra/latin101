and

When the Greeks could not seize Troy for ten years, Epeus made the wooden horse of amazing size.

Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus were gathered in it.

And they wrote on the horse, "The Greeks give a gift to Minerva", and they moved their tents to Tenedos.

When the Trojans saw it, they judged that the enemies had gone away; Priamus ordered the horse to be led in the temple of Minerva.

When the prophet Cassandra said the horse held enemies, trust was not given to her and they placed the horse in front of the temple.

The Greeks went out and killed the guards of the gate and conquered Troy.
