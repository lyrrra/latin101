When the Greeks could not seize Troy for ten years, Epeus made the wooden horse of amazing size.

Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus are gathered in it.

And they wrote on the horse, "The Greeks give a gift to Minerva", they moved their tents to Tenedos.

When the Trojans saw it, the enemies were thought to go away; Priamus ordered the horse to be led in the temple of Minerva.

When the prophet Cassandra said the horse held enemies, faith did not give it and they placed the horse in front of the temple.

The Greeks went out the gate and killed the guards and conquered Troy.
