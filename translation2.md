Long ago Prometheus, first son of Iapetus, made men out of mud. At the same time Vulcan made the woman out of mud. Minerva gave a soul to this woman, and all the gods sent their gifts. Because of this the name “Pandōra” was given to her. Pandōra was given into marriage with Epimetheus by Jupiter. Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
