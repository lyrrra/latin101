Long ago Prometheus, first son of Iapetus, made men out of mud. At the same time Vulcan made the woman out of mud. Minerva gave her soul to the woman and all the gods sent their gifts. Because of it the name “Pandōra” was a gift to her. Pandōra was given into marriage with Epimetheus by Jupitor. Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
