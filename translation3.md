Erechtheus, son of Pandīon, had four daughters.

but this action is defeated.  (**What do you think the antecedent of *hic* could be?**)
Neptūnus, angry because his son was killed by Erechtheus, said, "Erechtheus's daughter is sacrificing."  (**The gerundive does not state a fact. What kind of idea is Neptune stating?**)
Therefore Chthonia, one of the daugters, is sacrificed. The other sisters killed themselves. Erechtheus himself was struck by a lightning bolt.
